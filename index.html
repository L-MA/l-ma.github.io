Suzanne Young, on the surface, is an extremely accomplished financial analyst at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, with 20 years’ experience in the financial markets, who consistently ensures the long-term viability of multi-million dollar portfolios. She considers herself a “portfolio surgeon” who takes an unhealthy portfolio and makes an endurance athlete out of it. As such, she has produced healthy, enduring results for high echelon clients including major energy companies, hospitals and non-profits; senior corporate executives; and general counsels for multinational corporations. But more than an analyst, Ms. Young is a person who influences and persuades top ranking people; whose opinion is highly sought after; and whose judgment is respected and trusted.<br>
<br>
Ms. Young received her B.S. in Political Science from Northwestern in 1996. It was there that she developed her passion for geopolitics in South Asia, with a focus on topics such as self-government, political economy and sustainable development. After graduation, she rose through the ranks as a financial analyst for 14 years. She then spent one year at the Illinois Governor’s Office of Management and Budget, where, in addition to handling the office’s quantitative analysis needs and managing multi-billion-dollar bond deals, she wrote legislative language and contributed to policy development in the areas of bond issuance and debt service structure.<br>
<br>
During her most recent five-year tenure in the financial industry, Ms. Young has fed her insatiable interest in international natural resource and emerging markets investing through her research at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Her interest in the third world, however, is rooted in humanitarian concerns, as reflected by two missions to Honduras, Central America. It is there, with the red clay and tin roof dwellings, that her heart lies.<br>
<br>
Ms. Young is planning to apply to Public Policy graduate school for Fall 2011 and wishes to engage with thought leaders and high ranking decision makers in international public policy. She invites top players to challenge her, converse with her, and slog through the mud with her. Ms. Young’s ultimate goal is to become a national policy adviser, using her drive and untiring commitment to bring greater autonomy and dignity to the people of the developing world. With a Masters in Public Policy, she will be on the ground and in the trenches working toward that cause.<br>
